XpandShield MK2

Expansion shield with multiple I/O. Features multiple analog (and digital) inputs.

With 5 analog input via two joysticks and a linear actuator, the potential is almost endless. Plus a on-board high speed display and quite a few extra buttons, this will be all you need to make advanced projects requiring analog inputs. USB gamepad/mouse/keyboard/controller? You bet. Programmable robot control? Sounds very decent. Or just another fancy Arduboy? Well, that works too, if you want.
