XpandMouse Instructions

When you plug it in, the screen will display the splash screen. During this start-up sequence, no input or output is active. Furthermore, both sticks should be centered.

When the input screen light up, the mouse will be active and the mouse will, initially, randomly float around. Move both sticks to their maximum (up, down, left, right), and release them. The axis on the display should be centered.

After you calibrate the ThumbPointer, you can use the left joystick to navigate the mouse. The further you tilt the stick, the faster the mouse will move in that direction.

Left, right and middle mouse buttons are A, B and C (bottom row), while scroll is A and X (leftmost buttons on the right group). Or, button 1 and button 4.

button 8 (or SELECT) is scrambler toggle. You will notice a square light up and your mouse begin to move in a small square. This is adjustable via the left slide.
button 7 (or START) is autoclicker toggle.  You will see another square light up and a separate empty circle.
When the autoclicker is toggled on, pressing the left mouse button will toggle the autoclicker for the left button. Additional buttons (and functions such as long hold) may be planned.
When the autoclicker for the left button is on, a circle will rapidly flash between filled and empty. It indicate whether the left button is considered released or pressed at that moment.

The device run at 50fps. When autoclicker is on, the button will alternate between pressed and not pressed (e.g. it will be pressed for 20ms and unpressed for 20ms), for 25 clicks per second.
The autoclicker and scrambler is synced. It will click once every corner.


planned feature:
scrolling via the other ThumbPointer
some sort of menu to show device configs (and option to save Calibration info on EEPROM)
support multiple button autoclick
other functions such as button hold
